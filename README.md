# diagram : Graphviz and DOT Path Diagrams in Stata

__`diagram`__ generates dynamic diagrams using 
[DOT markup language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot)  
and exports images in __pdf__, __png__, __jpeg__, __gif__, and __bmp__ format. For 
more information [visit diagram homepage](http://www.haghish.com/dot). It can also generate diagrams automatically from Stata data set.

Installation
------------

__`diagram`__ package relies on __`webimage`__ package for exporting the graphs to various formats. For more information regarding the latter package, visit [__webimage__ on GitHub](https://github.com/haghish/webimage). Both packages are installable via GitHub. 

<!--
The __diagram__ releases are also hosted on SSC server. So you can download the latest release as follows:

    ssc install diagram   //NOT YET RELEASED ON SSC
    ssc install webimage  //NOT YET RELEASED ON SSC               


You can also directly download __diagram__ from GitHub which includes the latest beta version (unreleased). -->
<!--To install from GitHub, the `force` 
option ensures that you _reinstall_ the package, even if the release date is not yet changed. The release date only is changed for new releases and not for the current development.  -->

The __`diagram`__ package requires __`webimage`__ Stata package as well as `phantomJS` software. The [__`github package`__](https://github.com/haghish/github) can be used to install __`diagram`__ and its dependency, __`webimage`__ as shown below:

```js
github install haghish/diagram
```

<!--
    net install diagram,  force  from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/diagram/master/")
    net install webimage, force  from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/webimage/master/")
-->
  
For exporting graphical files, the  [__webimage__](https://github.com/haghish/webimage) package requires [phantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html), 
which is an open-source freeware available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The 
path to the executable [phantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) file is required in order to export the graphical files. However, if the executable file is installed in the default local 
directory (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/` in Mac), the `phantomjs(str)` can be ignored. 

Examples
------------

The __examples__ directory includes several examples for generating dynamic diagrams from `DOT` markup and Stata data sets. 



Example 1
---------

In the `examples` directory, there is a DOT file named `PATH1.txt` which draws a path diagram. The file is rendered by `diagram` command and exported to a PNG file directly from Stata:

    diagram using "./examples/PATH1.txt", export(./examples/example1.png)
	
![](./examples/example1.png)
